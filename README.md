# Ruby: Building Tic-Tac-Toe with Ruby
## A CLI tic-tac-toe game built with Ruby & Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

The objective of this project was to put into practice the core concepts of object oriented programming, mainly -- how to utilize classes and how to access their attributes. Here, I created an executable program of tic-tac-toe, a popular game played on a grid with 3 x 3 squares, which is played via the command line.

### How to Play: 
1. Player 1 is assigned X and Player 2 is assigned O, with player 1 starting first.
2. Each player then takes turns selecting an empty square in the board, starting with Player 1 to move.
3. A player wins if he/she can occupy 3 consecutive squares in a horizontal, diagonal or vertical line. 
3. This is done by entering any value from 1-3 for the x-coordinate (row) and the y-coordinate(column), respectively, during each player's turn.
4. The first player to get 3 of their marks in a row (diagonally, vertically, or horizontally) is declared the winner.
5. If all 9 squares are filled, and neither player has occupied 3 squares ina row with their given shape, then the game ends as a draw.
