# Elements needed:
# Player class to make two players
# Win conditions
# Rules
# Moves

# Classes - Player, Shape, Game Board
# Player - Needs to be assigned a shape and a name
# Game Board - Needs number of turns, W-L-D conditions
# main.rb file will call the game board, shape, and player classes

# Start with player and shape classes, then game board (this will be the hardest)

# Here you ask the users for their names and shapes

# puts 'enter name for player 1:'
# name1 = gets.chomp

# puts 'enter name for player 2: '
# name2 = gets.chomp

# puts 'enter shape for player 1: '
# shape1 = gets.chomp

# puts 'enter shape for player 2: '
# shape2 = gets.chomp

# Here player 1 is created with a given name and shape
# Here player 2 is created with a given name and shape
# Here a board is created with the two players competing

# Here you constantly ask the users via a loop to enter their move, until someone wins/loses or if there's a draw

# puts 'Player 1, please enter your desired x-coordinate: '
# x = gets.chomp.to_i

# puts 'Player 1, please enter your desired y-coordinate: '
# y = gets.chomp.to_i

# puts "Player 2, please enter your desired x-coordinate: "
# x = gets.chomp

# puts "Player 2, please enter your desired y-coordinate: "
# y = gets.chomp

# After each player enters their coordinates, the values are then plotted on the board for each turn.

# Until a win, loss, or draw is reached, then the game ends and the program exits.
